          I led the UX-phase of the redesign for the ViralHog platform. My team
          diagnosed and addressed the platform's usability issues through an
          in-depth UX audit. Our primary focus was on mobile-first approach for
          the redesign, aimed at tackling significant business challenges, such
          as enhancing content discoverability and user engagement, while also
          increasing user trust and conversion rates for they key user types. We
          worked towards ensuring that the redesign provides a friendly and
          consistent user experience in line with current industry standards and
          best practices. Our work involved simplifying long and complex user
          flows, eliminating bottlenecks and preventing errors. We developed a
          new information architecture and navigation system to further improve
          the overall user experience.
