        content: "In the world that is so   busy people tend to change jobs often. Millennials, who currently make up the majority of global workforce,\_have a reputation for job-hopping. ‘Unattached to organizations and institutions, people from this generation (…) are said to move freely from company to company, more so than any other generation.’ (Amy Adkins,\n\nI was tasked to work on a product that would encourage the best talent to stay with a single company. The client’s vision was to create a win-win situation for employees and employers - where employees stay happy and motivated to keep their performance high, while the employer retains their best talent.\n"

          First and foremost my goal was to get to know the primary users -
          their views, motivations and frustrations at work. I looked at their
          level of satisfaction at their current workplace and factors that
          conditioned


          I set up video interviews with millennials working at medium and large
          size corporations across all levels of seniority in various
          industries.

          Interview conducted with the client at the very beginning of the
          project revealed the below findings:


          The client is a fin-tech start-up made up of a group of people who
          have experience working in a big company in the past. The thing they
          have in common is the fact that they all started losing interest in
          the role after working for a company for a while and felt like they
          needed an extra motivation. Client's hypothesis is that:

          ‘People tend to be motivated by financial incentives. They love
          coupons and promotions and would stay loyal to certain shops only
          because they were getting good deals.'

        content: "Why medium to large size organisations need the product?\n\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_\n\nEmployee turnover cost is typically higher than retention cost. Employee Benefits News reported in 2017 that turnover can cost employers 33% of an employee’s annual salary. Additionally, ‘A 5% increase in employee retention can generate a 25% to 85% increase in profitability’. Source\n\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_\n\nTherefore, it’s clear that from financial point of view, it is in the employer’s best interest to keep their employees on board. More and more employers recognise that investing in an employee engagement program is cheaper than hiring new employees in the long run.\n\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_\n\nChartered Institute of Personnel and Development in their reports claims that ‘‘There’s a clear case for taking action and supporting employee financial well-being, making it an integral part of creating a healthy workplace where people can flourish, reach their potential and make a significant contribution to their organisation’s performance’ and that ’Improving financial well-being really is a the Holy Grail; it helps individual workers to get their finances on track as well as helps businesses to increase productivity, engagement and retention ‘(Jeanette Makings). At the same time they claim that ‘’Rewards and benefits form the most important building block for employees to improve finances ‘(CIPD).\n"
