Millennials, who currently make up the majority of global workforce,\_have a reputation for job-hopping. ‘Unattached to organizations and institutions, people from this generation (…) are said to move freely from company to company, more so than any other generation.’ (Amy Adkins,\n\nI was tasked to work on a product that would encourage the best talent to stay with a single company. The client’s vision was to create a win-win situation for employees and employers - where employees stay happy and motivated to keep their performance high, while the employer retains their best talent.\n"

          An interview conducted with the client at the very beginning of the
          project revealed the below findings:


          The client is a fin-tech start-up made up of a group of people who
          have experience working in a big company in the past. The thing they
          have in common is the fact that they all started losing interest in
          the role after working for a company for a while and felt a need for
          additional motivation to rekindle their enthusiasm. Client's
          hypothesis is that:
        _template: text
      - quote: >
          ‘People tend to be motivated by financial incentives. They love
          coupons and promotions and would stay loyal to certain shops only
          because they were getting good deals.'
        _template: quote
      - title: ' '
        content: "Therefore, the main business goal was to:\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_\n\n* Create a tool that supports employees in feeling satisfied and fulfilled at their workplace for a long time.\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_\n* Release a MVP and get feedback.\n"

        _template: text
      - title: Secondary users' goals
        content: "**Why do medium to large size organisations need the product?**\n\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_\n\nEmployee turnover cost is typically higher than retention cost. Employee Benefits News reported in 2017 that turnover can cost employers 33% of an employee’s annual salary. Additionally, ‘A 5% increase in employee retention can generate a 25% to 85% increase in profitability’. Source\n\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_\n\nTherefore, it’s clear that from financial point of view, it is in the employer’s best interest to keep their employees on board. More and more employers recognise that investing in an employee engagement program is cheaper than hiring new employees in the long run.\n"

        content: >
          First and foremost my goal was to get to know the primary users -
          their views, motivations and frustrations at work. I looked at their
          level of satisfaction at their current workplace and factors that
          conditioned it.


          My research objectives were to:


          * Understand millennials motivation factors at the workplace

          * Learn about what currently works and what doesn't

          * Identify what made them leave their previous workplace

          * Find opportunities to help them feel motivated at their workplace


          I set up video interviews with millennials working at medium and large
          size corporations across all levels of seniority in various
          industries.

          Main motivation factors were determined by asking users directly about
          them as well as talking about specific situations when they felt the
          most and least motivated at a workplace. Interestingly, more often
          than not, recalling specific situations revealed factors that users
          didn’t think about at first.

          Having established main motivators and user’s needs that our product
          would focus around solving I’ve decided to investigate existing tools
          my interviewees’ employers use to keep them satisfied and fulfilled.
          Those conversations helped me determine what works, what doesn’t work
          and why.

          I have chosen Sara as my primary persona and mapped out her experience

          keeping her goals and needs in mind. To inform this activity I asked
          one of my interviewees to show me how they use such platform at their
          workplace and describe their experience with it. The product used in
          this person workplace rewards users with gift vouchers. Vouchers are
          granted to people who were first nominated by their colleagues in a
          private message to their managers, and then selected by the manager.

Talking to potential users proved that people feel motivated by various factors. Therefore, an effective retention tool and reward system should be flexible and accommodate for users’ individual needs.\n\_ \_\n\nI referred back to user interviews and CIPD reports when trying to determine possible reward types. Charles Cotton & Jill Miller state that ‘while financial well-being exists at a personal level, a lack of it can (…) have a big impact on the workplace and society as whole worth a loss of productivity and effectiveness.’ At the same time ‘‘there is (…) a growing recognition that wellness is holistic and co-dependent; physical, emotional and financial health work together, and if one part is missing, this imbalance may also impact the other two.'\n\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_\n\nI put together a well-being tree based on CIPD report (green post-it notes) and put user interview findings about different workplace rewards (purple post-it notes) against the right category:\n"
