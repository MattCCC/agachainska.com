  description: >
    For the last 4+ years I’ve been conceptualising and crafting digital
    products for clients across various industries. I worked as a UX/UI designer
    in a brand-led creative consultancy for 3 years where I’ve learnt how to
    approach new projects with curiosity, beginner mindset, empathy and great
    deal of positive energy. In 2016 I graduated from BA Graphic Design at
    Kingston University in London. The course has taught me Design Thinking and
    it’s indispensible value. It’s became natural to me to incorporate Design
    Thinking principles in every project I work on. I’ve also learnt how to
    think outside the box and follow my guts when experimenting and developing
    brilliant ideas and unique solutions.


    I always strive to keep learning and grow, in every area in life. I
    constantly look for ways to challenge and improve myself as a designer. I
    love constructive criticism and always welcome feedback. I stay on top of
    the latest practices, patterns and trends by following design blogs,
    newsletters, participating in webinars, attending design community meet-ups
    and taking specialised courses.

    I’m in my element when collaborating and working as part of a team. I tend
    to build open and informal relationships which I believe help reaching
    mutual goals effectively and efficiently. In my role I focus on balancing
    business goals and technical constraints while keeping user’s behaviours,
    motivations and needs a priority. Whenever possible, I use data-driven and
    iterative approach when designing experiences. I recognise great importance
    of an in-depth user research, truly enjoy performing it and then brainstorm
    solutions. I trust the design process, I follow the double diamond design
    model when solving users’ problems.

        Before jumping into designing I make sure that I ask the right questions
