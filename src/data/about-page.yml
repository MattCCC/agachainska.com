    Hello! Thanks for stopping by, I’m glad 
    you’re here. I'm a passionate end-to-end 
    designer who focuses on building creative, 
    user-centered solutions that form  memorable 
    experiences. I currently freelance as UX/UI 
    consultant for clients across Europe.

  description: >
    For the last 4+ years I’ve been conceptualising 
    and crafting digital products for clients across 
    various industries. I worked as a UX/UI designer 
    in a brand-led creative consultancy for 3 years where 
    I’ve learnt how to approach new projects with curiosity, 
    beginner mindset, empathy and great deal of positive energy. 
    In 2016 I graduated from BA Graphic Design at 
    Kingston University in London. The course has 
    taught me Design Thinking and it’s indispensible 
    value. It’s became natural to me to incorporate 
    Design Thinking principles in every project I work on. 
    I’ve also learnt how to think outside the box and 
    follow my guts when experimenting and developing 
    brilliant ideas and unique solutions.

    I always strive to keep learning and grow, in every area in life. 
    I constantly look for ways to challenge and improve myself as
     a designer. I love constructive criticism and always welcome feedback. 
     I stay on top of the latest practices, patterns and trends by 
     following design blogs, newsletters, participating in webinars, 
     attending design community meet-ups and taking specialised courses.

    I’m in my element when collaborating and working as part of a team. 
    I tend to build open and informal relationships which I believe help 
    reaching mutual goals effectively and efficiently. In my role I focus on 
    balancing business goals and technical constraints while keeping user’s behaviours, 
    motivations and needs a priority. Whenever possible, I use data-driven and iterative 
    approach when designing experiences. I recognise great importance of an in-depth user 
    research, truly enjoy performing it and then brainstorm solutions. I trust the design process, 
    I follow the double diamond design model when solving users’ problems.
